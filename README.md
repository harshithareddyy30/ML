The *Car Evaluation System* uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository Car Evaluation dataset to predict a car’s safety rating. It applies a **Decision Tree Classifier** to categorize cars as *unacceptable, acceptable, good,* or *very good* based on features like price, maintenance cost, doors, seating capacity, luggage size, and safety level.
